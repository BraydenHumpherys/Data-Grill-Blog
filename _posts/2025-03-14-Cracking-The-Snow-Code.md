# Cracking the Snow Code: Using Weather Data to Predict Altaâ€™s Powder Days

By Brayden Humpherys

### Introduction

As a lifelong skier, I've always been fascinated by the weather patterns that dictate the quality of ski days. Planning a perfect ski trip can be challenging without knowing how much snow to expect. This project aims to predict the amount of snowfall at Alta, UT, three days in advance using historical weather data. By leveraging data science, we can make more informed decisions and enhance our skiing experiences.

### Motivation

The excitement of fresh powder days is unparalleled for any skier. However, predicting these days can be tricky. My goal is to use historical weather data to forecast snowfall, helping fellow skiers plan their trips better. This project combines my passion for skiing with my interest in data science, making it both relevant and exciting.
